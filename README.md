 Relativistic error analysis for the Global Positioning System
 
The principles of position determination and time transfer in the GPS can be very simply stated. Let there be four synchronized atomic clocks that transmit sharply defined pulses from the positions rj at times tj, with j = 1, 2, 3, 4 an index labelling the different transmission events. Suppose that these four signals are received at position r at one and the same instant t. Then, from the principle of the constancy of the speed of light,

where the defined value of c is exactly 299792458 m sâˆ’1. These four equations can be solved for the unknown space-time coordinates {r, t} of the reception event. Hence, the principle of the constancy of c finds application as the fundamental concept on which the GPS is based. Timing errors of one ns will lead to positioning errors of the order of 30 cm. Also, obviously, it is necessary to specify carefully the reference frame in which the transmitter clocks are synchronized, so that Eq. (1) is valid.
